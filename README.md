To send a happy holidays email to Elad:

1. `git clone`
2. `cd ./mailer`
3. `yarn`
4. `ts-node index` (can also be run with node but I use ts-node)
5. ????
6. PROFIT! (elad has new mail!)

P.S feel free to spam this to bombard elad with a plethora of emails :)

P.P.S: TODO: change SMTP credentials from the gmail account to the actual one you guys use at liwela.
